Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions.
    They only work with boolean (true, false) values. There are three logical operators
    1) !, | |, &&
  Why should we use Logical Operators:
    1) They can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.
  Not(!):
    it reverse the conditions.if something is true it will make it false
    and if something is false it will make it true.
            System.out.print(!true) => false
  Logical OR Operators (||):
    It can combines two or more conditions and returns true as long as the there is one
    condition is true. if all the conditions becomes false it returns us a false.
  Logical AND(&&):
    It can also combine two or more conditions. it only returns true if all the
    conditions are true.
