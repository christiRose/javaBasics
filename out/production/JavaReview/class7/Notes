While Loop:
    -They help us repeat code.

Why should we use while loops:
    -Because manually copying and pasting is very bad and it's not scalable.
        they also help us reduce the number of lines of code that we have to type

    Syntax Whileloop:
        while(condition){
        code that we want to repeat
        }

        EX
        int number2=0;
                while (number2<3){
                    System.out.println("Hello World");
                    number2++;
                    }

 Difference between Whileloop vs DoWhileLoop
    while: check condition then execute
    do while: execute then check condition

    int i=100;  // i <= 5 is false
    while (i<=5){
    System.out.println("hello"+i);
    i++;
    }
                ** 0 iterations

    int i=100; //i <= is false
    do{
    System.out.println("hello"+i);
     i++;
    }while (i<=5)
    }
            ** 1 iterations/execute atleast once
