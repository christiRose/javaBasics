Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions we can
    compare things if two entities are same or not if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are three main types of operators. They are:
     Arithmetic operators,
     Relational operators and
     Logigal  operators

Arithmetic operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to performs simple math operations. Like additions, subtraction etc.
       +  => Addition
       -  => Subtraction
       /  => Division
       *  => Multiplication
       %  => Modulus - calculate the remainder when dividing

Relational operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two qualities or entities. for example if something is bigger than
    other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
    Example:
    ==   => Used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otheerwise we get false.
    !=   => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. we get a true if they are not same.
    >    => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not. if greater we get a true.
    <    => opposite of > used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value on the right side we will get a true.
    >=   => if the values on left is greater than the value on the right side or if they are same we will get true.
    <=   => it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing
Conditional constructs
Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true that java execute
the code otherwise it skips that code.
How to write IfElse conditions:
    if(condition){
    any line of code even another if condition

If else conditions
    If I have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use If else if
    If I have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions

Important Notes:
   1) for String we use equals method instead of == sign because it is a non-primitive data type
   2) We can cmd+opt+l(Mac) ctrl+alt+l (Windows) to format our code.
   3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.
