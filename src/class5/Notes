Scanner class:
-a simple class just like java
-Helps use the input from keyboard.

logical operators:
   - -Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values.
   --only work with boolean
   --There are 3 logical operators: !, ||, &&

Why should we learn the logical operators?
    -we can greatly simplify the logic if we use these operators

What is the syntax:
    -they only work with boolean datatype
    -if (! condition)
    -if (condition1 || condition2)
    -if (condition1 && condition2)

   NOT Operator(!)
    NOT is used to navigate the boolean values if something is true it will make it false
    if something false it will make it true.

What is a SwitchCase statement:
    -Switch case statement are just another way of achieving the same results as if-else-if conditions

Why should we learn about this:
    -The reason we should use them is they are very fast.

Syntax:

String var:
    switch (var){
    case 1:
    System.out.println("1");
    break;
    }
EX:

switch (condition){
case 1:
{output}
break;
case 2:
{output}
break;
default;
{otherwise output}

Rules that we should follow:
    -we can only use byte, short, int, char, String in switch case statements.
    -we cannot use relational operators in switch case statement
             are also not allowed
    -we cant use logical operators
